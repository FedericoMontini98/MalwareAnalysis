# 👾 Malware Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze the behaviour of some malicious Android applications using Antimalwares, **Static** and **Dynamic Analysis**. To understand which are the most common practices between different implementations and malware families a small group malwares will be analyzed. The goal of this project is to detect which APK are malicious, understand how the payload is triggered and which is its purpose.

## 🔨 Used Tools
In order to reach our goal few tools has been used:  
- **VirusTotal** and **Jotti**: Virustotal and Jotti are online services that allow users to analyze files and URLs for potential malware or malicious content. Virustotal is a free online service that provides a comprehensive malware scanning and detection platform. The service then generates a detailed report that includes information about the file’s or URL’s detection status across different antivirus engines returning also a brief behavioural analysis report. Jotti, instead, allows users to upload files for scanning by multiple antivirus engines. Unlike Virustotal, Jotti focuses solely on file scanning and does not offer URL scanning.  
- **MobSF**: is an open-source tool used for automated security testing of mobile applications. It performs static and dynamic analysis to identify vulnerabilities and security risks in apps for Android and iOS. MobSF checks the app’s code, resources, and behavior, detecting issues like insecure data storage, communication, and tampering. It integrates with other security tools and generates detailed reports with recommendations for fixing vulnerabilities.  
- **Genymotion**: is an Android emulator used for app development and testing. It creates virtual Android devices with various configurations, allowing developers to test their apps without physical hardware. Genymotion supports device sensors, networking capabilities, and integrates with popular development tools. It will be used to provide the secure environment for dynamic analysis.

## ☠️ Malwares List
The project will analyze a total of five Android application which are named with their SHA-256 hash values:
